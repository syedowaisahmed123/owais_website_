</br> <p> <font size="6" color="black"> The Electronics and Telecomunication Engineering courses is design</br>
in a such a way that at the end of courses, the student is throughly prepared with the basic </br>
knowledge of Electronics and Telecomunication  Engineering and becomes well conversent with </br>
specialized feild like Digital Signal Processing, Computer and Comunication Networks, wireless Network,</br>
Optical Fiber Comuniction Data Compression, and Encryption and Microwave Communication</p>
<p>Electronic Engineering is a diverse subject that derives its braedth</br>
from the need to design and manufacture every thing frome small individual parts and divices</br>
to large system and machines. The role of a Electronic Engineering is to take a product frome a idea</br>
to the marketplace. in order yo acompolish this , a broad range of skills are needed. The Mechanical engineer</br>
needs to aquire particular skills and knowledge . He/She needs to understand the forces and the thermal</br
enviroment that a product and its parts or its subsystem will be encounter</p>
<p>  Electronic Engineering  Department has well equiped Laboratories for the</br>
Conduction of Practicals with skilled Lab Assistent . The Spacious cassrooms along with projectors </br>
and LCD's are avialable . The department has grown tremandously and developed </br>
strong link between building and Construction Industries </p></font>

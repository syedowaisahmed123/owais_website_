<p>In the present scenario of globalization, there is tremendous demand for</br> skilled manpower particularly in the area of Engineering and Technology. </br>The education of a future professional engineer cum manager</br> is incomplete without the exposure to working in an organization.</br> Therefore, the Training and Placement (T&P) cell was set up </br>with a view to provide necessary impetus to launch our students into</br> the real world where cut-throat competition is the order of the day. </br>The Training and Placement Cell plays a vital role in finding suitable job opportunities</br> for students and at same time tying up with industries and professional </br>organizations for fruitful and mutually beneficial linkages. Training and</br> Placement cell is a must to explore the possibilities of training for the</br> undergraduate students as well as employment to the outgoing BE students of the college.</br></p>

<p>PDA College of Engineering has a Corporate Relations & Placement Cell</br> dedicated for strengthening the interaction between institute</br> and industry. The Cell works round the year effectively and efficiently</br> to liaison with major organizations. The strength of the Placement Cell lies</br> in imparting perfect soft-skill as well as technical training rendered by</br> experts to develop the strength of our students and mould them into </br>competent professionals. The real key to the effectiveness of professionals </br>is their ability to put their domain knowledge into effective practice</br> and in this context, we at the placement cell have a crucial role to play.</br></p>

<p>The Training and Placement department motivates the students by providing the</br> necessary help and guidance for their personality development. </br>They are exposed to various organizations and corporate sectors, </br>through expert lectures and short-term courses. The pre final and the</br> final year students are privileged to train themselves in practical</br> industrial training arranged during summer/winter vacations</br> in various public and private organizations.</br></p>
Nearly 50% of the students perform their final year projects in industries. </br>Each year more than 40 % to 50 % students are placed through this cell. The training and placement cell</br> is active to keep touch with the industry and invites</br> them to come and visit the institute for campus interviews.</br>
